# HC-05-Analog-Clock
This project transforms a traditional analog alarm clock into a smart device that can be controlled via a smartphone. By integrating an Arduino HC-05 Bluetooth module, a small DC motor, and a custom smartphone app, this project allows the alarm clock's bells to ring upon receiving an external Bluetooth signal.
